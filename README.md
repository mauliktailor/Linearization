## Linearization

Linearization, a probelm of **Natural Language Processing**, is the task of recovering the original word order from the shuffled sentence. The predominant argument of the more recent works is that jointly recovering explicit syntactic structure is crucial for determining the correct word order of the original sentence. As such, these methods either generate or rely on given parse structure to reproduce the order.

I have Implemented Linearization using two approach:
1) **Classical Approach:** Used n-grams and beam search.
2) **Deep Learning Approach:** Used Encoder-Decoder neural netwok with Attention.
